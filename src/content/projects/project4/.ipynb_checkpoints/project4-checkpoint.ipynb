    "As part of this project, you will participate in a sponsored search auction, much like the one Google uses to select the ads it displays during a query. You will design and implement a bidding algorithm where the goal is to maximize the number of clicks you can obtain in a series of generalized second price auctions, competing with other teams in the class. Each team will be given a budget of $10,000 (imaginary dollars, of course!). Although there will be a bonus for doing well in the final auction, this will not be the primary factor in grading this assignment. We are more interested in how you understand the theory and develop your algorithm.\n",

You may continue to work with the same people you have worked on for previous projects, but are encouraged to consider whether it would be more beneficial to gain experience working with others by switching your team."

    "## Auction Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Google's ad words auctions, we will use a _generalized second price auction_ where you will be bidding for an ad position on a web page. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary reference papers for this assignment are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Benjamin Edelman, Michael Ostrovsky, and Michael Schwarz. [_Internet Advertising and the Generalized Second-Price Auction:Selling Billions of Dollars Worth of Keywords_](//uvammm.github.io/docs/edelman.pdf). American Economic Review 2007.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hal Varian. [_Position Auctions_](//uvammm.github.io/docs/position.pdf). International Journal of Industrial Organization 2007.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each auction there will be three advertisement slots available, with slot 1 being at the top, slot 2 being below 1, and 3 below 2. These correspond to the most desirable placements on the generated page. For the same ad and user population, slot 1 has a click rate of 6%, slot 2 has a click rate of 3%, and slot 3 has a click rate of 1%. Slots are sold in a _pay-per-click_ fashion where a bidder pays for a slot only if their ad is clicked. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each auction proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Participants submit their bids.\n",
    "2. A user arrives and submits a search query.\n",
    "3. The bids are ranked by magnitude with the top three bids that exceed the reserve price (25 cents) getting the three available slots.\n",
    "4. The highest bidder out of those three receives the first slot, the second highest bidder receives slot 2, and the third highest bidder receives slot 3.\n",
    "5. A bidder pays only if their ad is clicked and the payment rules are as follows:\n",
    "    * Bidder 1 pays a price equal to bid 2\n",
    "    * Bidder 2 pays a price equal to bid 3\n",
    "    * Bidder 3 pays a price equal to bid 4 or the reserve price, whichever is higher\n",
    "    \n",
    "Notice that a winning bidder only pays when their ad gets clicked, and we assume that at most one ad will be clicked per user search query. After the auction takes place, the bidder is notified if the user clicked on your ad or not. If the bidder's ad received a click, the message returned to you will tell you the slot you were in and the price you paid, relayed as (slot, price). The message \"user did not click on your ad\" will be returned if you won the auction but received no click or if you lost the auction. Therefore, you should be thinking about optimization strategies that fit into this limited information framework. \n"

To simulate the bidding environment, you can draw random bids from a bounded distribution, order all bids, and follow the rules of the auction design above.
