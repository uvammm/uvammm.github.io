      <description>Project 2 is now posted, and is due Tuesday, 4 February (9:29am).
For Project 2, you will develop your model from Project 1, with a goal of improving the the &amp;ldquo;Zestimate&amp;rdquo; residual error using the data for 2017 in the Kaggle Zillow prize competition. The Kaggle competition has been concluded, so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to settle for learning, wisdom, and glory in place of Zillow&amp;rsquo;s $1.2M prize.
We will run a competition in class on February 4 to see which model works best on a (secret until then) testing data set.</description>
