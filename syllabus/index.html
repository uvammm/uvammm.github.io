<h1 id="course-description">Course Description</h1>

<p>This course explores connections between Computer Science and
Economics, and aims to develop students who can work in
interdisciplinary teams to use techniques from both computer science
and economics to solve important societal problems.</p>

<p>Likely topics include causation, statistical machine learning, natural
experiments, resource allocation, game theory, auction theory,
mechanism design, and privacy.</p>

<h1 id="assignments">Assignments</h1>

<p>The main assignments for the class will be a series of team projects
where students will be grouped into teams of two to four students,
including both computer scientists and economists. The project teams
and assignments will emulate the work of real interdisciplinary teams
at leading companies. It will be the team&rsquo;s responsibility to
distribute the tasks, communicate with each other and explain in the
project report what part of the project was completed by what team
member.</p>

<p>For the final project, students will have an opportunity to define
their own open-ended project to answer an interesting question about
the world using methods and techniques from the class.</p>

<p>In addition to the project assignments, there will be reading
assignments and other preparation assignments for classes, and there
may be some individual problem sets or quizzes (we hope that these
will not be necessary, but will use them if it seems like they will be
helpful for improving engagement in the class, or if there are
students who are not contributing fully to team assignments).</p>

<p>The due dates for the projects are below.  Unless specified different,
projects will be due at the beginning of class on the due date.</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday, 21 January:</strong> Project 1: Predictions from Data (warm-up)<br />
<strong>Thursday, 30 January:</strong> Project 2: Market Predictions<br />
<strong>Thursday, 13 February:</strong> Project 3: Allocating Kidneys<br />
<strong>Tuesday, 3 March:</strong> Project 4: On-Line Auctions</p>

<h3 id="final-project">Final Project</h3>

<p><strong>Thursday, 19 March:</strong> Team and General Idea<br />
<strong>Sunday, 29 March:</strong> Project Proposal<br />
<strong>Thursday, 9 April:</strong> Progress Report<br />
<strong>23 or 28 April:</strong> Final Presentations<br />
<strong>Tuesday, 28 April:</strong> Final Project Report</p>

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>

<p>Grading will be based primarily on your performance on the projects,
with adjustments for outstanding contributions to the class.  For team
projects, everyone in a team will normally receive the same grade,
except in situations where there are problems or where not all team
members contribute fully to the project. All students are expected to
be present at all the project meetings and presentations.</p>

<p>Grades will be calculated with several different weightings, where
your grade is based primarily on whichever weighting results in the
highest score. The range of possible weightings is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Project 1: 0-5%</li>
<li>Project 2: 5-15%</li>
<li>Project 3: 10-20%</li>
<li>Project 4: 10-25%</li>
<li>Final Project: 25-75%</li>
<li>Class Contribution: 0-25%</li>
</ul>

<p>Spend your energy focusing on what you are learning, instead of
worrying about your grade.</p>

<h2 id="honor">Honor</h2>

<p>We believe strongly in the value of a <em>community of trust</em>, and expect
all of the students in this class to contribute to strenghtening and
enhancing that community.</p>

<p>As a student at the University of Virginia, you are trusted to be
honorable and expected to behave in ways that merit that trust. We
take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment
for everyone.  The course will be better for everyone if everyone can
assume everyone else is trustworthy, and we start from the assumption
that all students at the university deserve to be trusted.</p>

<p>For most assignments in this course, you will be expected to work in a
team.  We expect you to be honest, fair, and respectful with your
teammates, and to contribute fully to your team to the best of your
ability.  We also expect you to notify the course staff if there are
any problems with your team, or if you have teammates that are not
behaving honorably.</p>

<p>You will always be expected to credit any collaborators and properly
cite any resources you use.</p>

<h3 id="expectations-and-accommodations">Expectations and Accommodations</h3>

<p>If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or
requirements of this course, please meet with one of the instructors
outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with
disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access
Center to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this
course, including official accommodations. Please visit their website
for information on this process and to apply for services online:
